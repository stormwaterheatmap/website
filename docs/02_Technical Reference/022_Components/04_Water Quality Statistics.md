Water Quality Statistics
================

We developed a series of linear mixed effects models to estimate
concentrations for constituents of concern (COCs) in Puget Sound urban
stormwater. Spatial covariates in the models included various landscape
predictors, rainfall, seasonal components, and in some models, percent
land use (commercial, industrial, residential).

## Data Sources

### Outfall Data

The primary source of measured stormwater data is the S8.D Municipal
Stormwater Permit Outfall Data (referred to as the S8 Data in this
document) provided by the Washington Department of Ecology (Hobbs et
al., 2015). Special Condition S8.D of the 2007-2012 Phase I Municipal
Stormwater Permit required permittees to collect and analyze data to
evaluate pollutant loads in stormwater discharged from different land
uses: high density (HD) residential, low density (LD) residential,
commercial, and industrial. Phase I Permittees[1] collected water
quality and flow data, sediment data, and toxicity information from
stormwater discharges during storm events. Stormwater data collected
from a total of 16 outfalls by six Phase I Permittees was utilized in
this modeling study.

The stormwater outfall data are available from Ecology via an open-data
api at:
[https://data.wa.gov/Natural-Resources-Environment/Municipal-Stormwater-
Permit-Outfall-Data/d958-q2ci.](https://data.wa.gov/Natural-Resources-Environment/Municipal-Stormwater-%20Permit-Outfall-Data/d958-q2ci.%20)

COCs analyzed in this study are:

-   Copper – Total

-   Total Suspended Solids (TSS)

-   Phosphorus – Total

-   Zinc - Total

-   Total Kjeldahl Nitrogen (TKN)

We extracted data for these COCs, and performed minimal data cleaning.
We filtered out rejected data (values with a R or REJ flag), removed
replicates, and removed one data point for TKN that was an outlier (an
order of magnitude higher than the majority of the data). Figure 4.1
shows data before removal of the outlier.

nitrogen (TKN)

### Censored (Non-Detect) Data

Nearly all COCs had non-detect (left-censored) data present (Table 4.1).
Ecology flagged non-detect data and provided the reporting limit for
each non-detect value. Most COCs had a very small percentage of data
that were non-detect (2% or less); one COC, TKN, had a higher level of
non-detect data (just over 10%). For all COCs, non-detect values were
substituted with one-half of the reporting limit. Models using censored
methods were compared to linear models for TKN to verify that data
substitution on linear mixed effects models generated suitable results.

(non-detect) for each chemical of concern

### Transformation of outfall data

Each COC was then evaluated for its underlying distribution, to
determine whether transformation would be beneficial prior to running a
linear mixed effects model on the results. Quantile-quantile plots (QQ
plots) using a normal distribution, gamma distribution, square-root
transformed distribution, and log-transformed distribution were visually
analyzed. For all COC’s, log-transformation was deemed an appropriate
data transformation prior to model analysis (Fig. 4.2).

scale. Red line shows the QQ-line.

## Spatial Data

For this study, we did not rely on the permittee’s self-reported land
use type to run regression models predicting pollution loading from land
use. A visual scan of our land cover data layer versus self-reported
land use types revealed little agreement among permittee definitions of
the four land use types (high density residential, low density
residential, commercial, industrial). Therefore, we compiled a suite of
continuous datasets from which to run chemical loading models. We divide
these into land use and landscape data.

### Land Use

In order to employ a consistent analysis across different monitored
watersheds we extracted land use data from the Washington Department of
Commerce Land Use: [Puget Sound Mapping Project](https://www.commerce.wa.gov/serving-communities/growth-management/puget-sound-mapping-project).
Land use classes (also listed in Table 4.2) include:

-   Intensive urban (includes commercial areas, apartment buildings)

-   Urban residential (includes the majority of urban and suburban
    single-family dwellings)

-   Rural residential

-   Industrial

In addition, we combined some land use classes to generate additional
land use classes:

-   Total residential (urban residential + rural residential)

-   Intensive Urban + Industrial; the industrial land use category did
    not have many non-zero data points

### Landscape Data

For each watershed contained in the S8 dataset, potentially relevant
landscape data were extracted from the following sources (Table 4.2):

develop statistical models.

### Pre-processing of spatial data

In order to use the landscape data at an appropriate scale across the
study area, spatial predictors were stacked and then convolved with a
100-meter gaussian kernel. This resulted in “fuzzy” predictors that
could apply across dataset boundaries. These values were then extracted
for each monitored watershed.

Prior to use, spatial data were plotted and visually assessed for
outliers (Fig. 4.3). Square-root transformation was performed on spatial
data sets with outliers that were higher than the rest of the
predictor’s values: popn, traffic, slope, CO2_res, CO2_com, CO2_road,
CO2_nonroad, CO2_tot. The devAge spatial predictor had a low data
outlier; devAge values were squared to address the low outlier. Figure
4.4 shows the spatial data following transformation.

Prior to use in models, spatial data sets were scaled and centered using
the mean and standard deviation from the 14 watersheds in this study.

### Precipitation Data

Daily rainfall data were obtained from the [DayMet website operated by
NASA](https://daymet.ornl.gov). Daily data were obtained for years
2009 to 2013, and cumulative one day, three day, and seven day, 14-day,
21-day and 28-day antecedent precipitation were calculated for each
sampling date. For example, for a sampling date of March 22, cumulative
three-day precipitation would include precipitation occurring on March
20, 21 and 22. For each COC, *ln*-transformed chemical concentrations
were plotted against each precipitation measurement, and the plots were
visually assessed to select the most appropriate time scale for
precipitation. Cumulative 21-day precipitation was selected for copper
and phosphorus, while 1-day precipitation was selected for TSS.

## Model Construction and Selection

Selection of the best model for each COC was performed using the
methodology of Zuur al. (2009), as outlined in the steps below.
Statistical analyses and model fitting were performed in R (R Core Team,
2021).

### Step 1. Select strong potential landscape predictors

The initial step was to find a suitable set of potential landscape
predictors for the COC in question. Single-predictor linear models were
constructed for the relationship between *ln*-transformed chemical
concentration and each landscape predictor, in turn. Plots were visually
assessed to determine candidate predictors for linear mixed effects
models. We looked for slopes with a p-value of \< 0.05, and for data
points to fall roughly along the best fit model line. If prior knowledge
indicated the importance of certain predictors, those were also included
in the set of candidate predictors.

### Step 2. Construct a beyond-optimal model, controlling for collinearity

The starting point of our model selection process was a “beyond-optimal”
model, where the fixed component of the mixed effects model contained as
many strong landscape predictors as possible. To prevent using highly
correlated landscape predictors together in statistical models, we
calculated calculated the correlation coefficient for each coefficient
pair of landscape predictors, and eliminated select predictors to reduce
correlation. We then constructed a generalized leas squared (gls) model
in R (nlme package, Pinheiro et al., 2021) using the beyond-optimal set
of fixed effects, and utilizing restricted maximum likelihood estimation
(REML).

Throughout the model selection process, highly correlated landscape
predictors (correlation coefficient ≥0.85) were not used together in any
models.

### Step 3. Control for heterogeneity (heteroskedasticity)

Normalized residuals from the “beyond-optimal” gls model were plotted
against the model’s fitted values, and examined for heteroskedasticity.
We also plotted residuals against agency, year, season, land use,
precipitation, antecedent dry days, and all potential predictors, to
look for patterns in residuals. If residual plots showed evidence of
heteroskedasticity, we tried a series of gls models (fitted with REML)
with different variance structures that utilized agency, season, and
precipitation as variance covariates. Variance structure for each COC
was selected based on the lowest Akaike information criterion (AIC) and
Bayesian information criterion (BIC) scores.

### Step 4. Find the proper random effects structure

Next, we used the beyond-optimal model with the correct variance
structure to find the proper random effects structure. The
beyond-optimal gls model was compared to a linear mixed effects (lme)
-random intercept model (nlme package, Pinheiro et al., 2021) fitted
with REML, where the intercept was allowed to change per agency. Because
the gls model and the random intercept model are nested, the two models
were compared using a likelihood ratio test to see if one model was
significantly better than the other (p-value \< 0.05). The best-fit
model was then selected based on the lowest AIC value. For all COCs, the
random intercept model fit the data better than the gls model with no
random effects.

A random intercept for agency is suitable for the stormwater data
because there were opportunities for each agency to differ slightly in
sample collection methodologies. Selection of lab for sample analysis,
timing of sample collection once a storm began, and any biases in
selection of representative watersheds by each agency are possible
factors that could lead to unintended differences in COC results. These
unintended differences can be captured in the random component of the
model.

### Step 5. Check for temporal and spatial correlation

The beyond-optimal model with the correct variance structure and random
effects structure was then examined for evidence of temporal and spatial
auto-correlation. Temporal auto-correlation plots were generated and
visually assessed for indications of correlation between various
sampling time lags; no evidence of temporal autocorrelation was found
for any COC.

To assess for spatial auto-correlation, we used two methods: variograms,
and spatially-explicit bubble plots of model residuals.

All tests for temporal and spatial auto-correlation were repeated
following selection of best-fit models.

### Step 6. Find the proper fixed effects structure

We used the strong potential landscape predictors from step 1 to
generate an exhaustive set of fixed-effects formulae with combinations
of one, two and three potential landscape predictors. Predictors with
high correlation coefficients (≥0.85) were not allowed to be in formulae
together.

A set of models was generated using the fixed effects formulae, along
with the best-fit random effects and variance structures identified in
steps 3 and 4. Linear mixed effects models were applied using the nlme
package (Pinheiro et al, 2021), and fitting with maximum likelhood (ML)
estimation[2]. Models where the sign (+ or –) of the predictor
coefficients did not match the coefficient signs from the linear model
from step 1 were discarded. Models were then sorted according to AIC
value, and the top 20 models were examined for fit to individual
predictors. Plots of residuals versus fitted values, agency, location,
and landscape predictors were also examined. Based on these criteria,
one to three models were selected for consideration as the best
landscape predictor model. The top one to three candidate models all had
low AIC values, decent residual plots, and good fit to individual
landscape predictors.

Using knowledge of chemical contaminant mobilization into stormwater, we
selected the best landscape predictor model for each COC.

Three models were ultimately fitted with REML and compared for each COC:

1.  **Null Model:** COC concentration is equal to median COC
    concentration over all sampling dates and locations

2.  **Categorical Land Use Model:** COC concentration is modeled as a
    linear mixed effects model, utilizing land use category (HDR, LDR,
    COM, IND), precipitation (rainfall and/or antecedent dry days), and
    season (for COCs where a seasonal trend appeared in the data).

3.  **Landscape Predictor Model:** COC concentration is modeled as a
    linear mixed effects model, utilizing up to three landscape
    predictors, precipitation (rainfall and/or antecedent dry days), and
    season (for COCs where a seasonal trend appeared in the data).

## Results

Results for each COC are provided below.

### Copper

Based on linear models of *ln*-transformed copper versus individual
predictors, the strong predictors identified for copper include: totRes,
intURB, intURB_IND, grass, greenery, impervious, nodev, sqrt_traffic,
sqrt_popn, pm25_na, sqrt_CO2_tot, sqrt_CO2_com, sqrt_CO2_road,
sqrt_CO2_nonroad, devAge2, roof_intURB_IND (Fig 4.5).

**Figure 4.5** Strong predictors for copper, showing linear model fit
(blue line) for the relationship between ln-transformed copper
concentration and each predictor in turn.

The precipitation predictor used for copper was 21-day cumulative
precipitation. In addition, evidence of higher copper concentrations
during summer led us to add *summer* as a categorical predictor to the
copper model (where *summer* = 1 during July, August, September, and
*summer* = 0 for all other months).

Residuals plotted against fitted values showed signs of slight
heterogeneity (Fig 4.6, left plot). Of the variance structures tested,
the best fit allows residual variation to differ by agency *j*

![
var(\\epsilon_j) = \\sigma^2_j
](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.image?%5Cdpi%7B110%7D&space;%5Cbg_white&space;%0Avar%28%5Cepsilon_j%29%20%3D%20%5Csigma%5E2_j%0A "
var(\epsilon_j) = \sigma^2_j
")

![](images/Copper%20variance%20structure%20plots%20fig_4_6.bmp)

**Figure 4.6** Normalized residuals from beyond-optimal model, with no
variance structure (left), and with the best fit variance structure
(right).

The best model for copper is a random-intercept model, where the
intercept of the linear model is allowed to shift up or down according
to agency. No signs of temporal or spatial auto-correlation were
detected in auto-correlation plots or variograms.

With the variance structure and random components set, two possible
models emerged to capture the fixed effects:

$$
\begin{aligned} 
\allowbreak \ln(Copper) \sim rain + summer + sqrt.traffic + totRES
\allowbreak 
\end{aligned}
$$
$$
\allowbreak 
\ln(Copper) \sim rain + summer + sqrt.traffic + devAge2 +  pm25.na + rain:pm25.na
$$

The first model’s AIC score was lower than that of the second model
(AIC=756.3 vs. 781.8, when models were fitted with ML); however, the
model coefficient for totRES is negative, indicating that increased
residential zoning results in reduced copper concentrations in
stormwater. This relationship makes sense for the 14 watersheds in our
study, but would likely not be appropriate for forested landscapes that
have low residential zoning (thus should have high copper
concentrations). As a result, we selected the second model as the most
suitable for covering the entire area of the stormwater heatmap. Figure
4.7 shows the model fit for each individual predictor, plotted against
data points. Correlation between the three predictors was low (maximum
correlation = 0.4). Figure 4.8 shows the interaction between rain and
pm25_na, with higher pm25_na values in reds and oranges, and lower
pm25_na values in blues and purples. This interaction shows that, when
pm2.5 values are high, increasing amounts of rainfall result in a
dilution of copper in stormwater.

Landscape Predictor Model to each predictor in turn. Model fitting was

**Figure 4.8** Plot showing the interaction between rain and pm25_na
that is present in the best fit model. In areas with high pm25_na
values, increasing amounts of rain result in a dilution of copper in
stormwater. Model fitting was performed using maximum likelihood (ML)
estimation.

Comparisons between the Null Model, Categorical Land Use Model, and
Landscape Predictor Model can be visualized through residuals (Fig.
4.9), comparative metrics such as AIC (Table 4.3, and coefficient values
(Table 4.2; Fig. 4.10). Although the AIC value for the Categorical Land
Use Model is lower than that of the Landscape Predictor Model, we are
not confident in the transferability of the Categorical Land Use Model
to watersheds outside of the 14 in this study. Two of the land use
categories (Industrial – IND; and Low Density Residential – LDR) each
have only two watershed representatives in our study. This results in
good model fit to the data, but not necessarily for all watersheds in
Puget Sound area.

watershed, with colors representing agencies. Model fitting was

**Table 4.3** Coefficient values (standard error in parenthesis) for the
three copper models. For the Categorical Landuse Model, the baseline
landuse is LDR; all other land use categories are adjustments from the
baseline. Final coefficient values for linear mixed effects mdels are
based on fitting with restricted maximum likelihood (REML) estimation,
and may differ slightly from those fitted using maximum likelihood (ML)
estimation.

Final coefficient values for linear mixed effects models are based on
fitting with restricted maximum likelihood (REML) estimation, and may
differ slightly from those fitted using maximum likelihood (ML)
estimation.

The Landscape Predictor Model for total copper, used as the basis for
the Stormwater Heatmap total copper layer, is:

$$ 
ln(Copper) = 2.22 - 0.14*rain + 0.41*summer + 0.34*sqrt.traffic + 0.56*devAge2 + 0.75*pm25.na - 0.07*rain:pm25.na
$$


where rain is 21-day cumulative precipitation, and summer is a factor
with value = 1 for July, August, September, and value = 0 for all other
months. Note that all predictors (except summer) were first transformed
if necessary (e.g. traffic was square-root transformed, devAge was
squared to make devAge2), then standardized prior to use.

### Total Suspended Solids

Based on linear models of *ln*-transformed TSS versus individual
predictors, the strong predictors identified for TSS include: totRES,
sqrt_traffic, sqrt_popn, sqrt_CO2_res, sqrt_CO2_tot, sqrt_CO2_com,
sqrt_CO2_road, devAge2 (Fig 4.11). Paved was added to the list because
it was a strong predictor for an older version of the model, and paved
areas are associated with elevated TSS in stormwater.

![](images/TSS%20best%20predictors%20linear%20models.bmp)

**Figure 4.11** Strong predictors for TSS, showing linear model fit
(blue line) for the relationship between *ln*-transformed TSS
concentration and each predictor in turn. Although it wasn’t as
compelling on its own, the predictor paved was added to the list of
strong predictors because it was a strong predictor in a previous model.

The precipitation predictor used for TSS was 1-day cumulative
precipitation. There was no evidence of seasonal patterns to TSS in
stormwater.

Residuals plotted against fitted values showed signs of slight
heterogeneity (Fig 4.12, top left plot). Of the variance structures
tested, the best fit was for a combination of two variance structures,
where residual variation differs by agency *j*, and also by rainfall at
each location *i* and date *k*:
Residuals plotted against fitted values showed signs of slight heterogeneity (Fig 4.12, top left plot). Of the variance structures tested, the best fit was for a combination of two variance structures, where residual variation differs by agency j, and also by rainfall at each location i and date k:

$$\epsilon_{ijk} = \sigma^2_j * \exp^{2\delta * rain_{ik}}$$
 
 

<!-- $$


\epsilon_{ijk} = \sigma^2_j * \exp^{2\delta * rain_{ik}}
$$ -->

The second best fit allows residual variation to differ by agency j:

$$\epsilon_j = \sigma^2_j$$

Visual inspection of residuals generated using the two candidate
variance structures did not indicate a strong benefit to using the more
complex variance structure. As a result, we used the simpler variance
structure with only agency as a variance covariate.

![](images/TSS%20variance%20structure.bmp)

**Figure 4.12** Normalized residuals from beyond-optimal model, with no
variance structure (top left), agency as a variance covariate (top
right) and the best fit variance structure with agency and rain as
variance covariates (bottom left).

The best model for TSS is a random-intercept model, where the intercept
of the linear model is allowed to shift up or down according to agency.
No signs of temporal or spatial auto-correlation were detected in
auto-correlation plots or variograms.

With the variance structure and random components set, two possible
models emerged to capture the fixed effects:

$$
\ln(TSS) \sim rain + sqrt.traffic + totRES
$$

$$
\ln(TSS) \sim rain + sqrt.traffic + paved
$$

The AIC score for these two models was very close, with the first
model’s AIC score slightly lower (AIC=1253.5 vs. 1255.8, when models
were fitted with ML). In the first model, the coefficient for totRES is
negative, indicating that increased residential zoning results in
reduced TSS in stormwater. This relationship makes sense for the 14
watersheds in our study, but would likely not be appropriate for
forested landscapes that have low residential zoning (thus should have
high TSS concentrations). As a result, we selected the second model as
the most suitable for covering the entire area of the stormwater
heatmap. Figure 4.13 shows the model fit for each individual predictor,
plotted against data points. Correlation between the two predictors was
low (correlation coefficient \< 0.1).

![](images/TSS%20single%20predictor%20plots.bmp)

**Figure 4.13** Single-predictor plots for TSS, showing fit of the
Landscape Predictor Model to each predictor. Model fitting was performed
using maximum likelihood (ML) estimation.

Comparisons between the Null Model, Categorical Land Use Model, and
Landscape Predictor Model can be visualized through residuals (Fig.
4.14) comparative metrics such as AIC and BIC (Table 4.4), and
coefficient values (Table 4.4; Fig. 4.15). The AIC value is slightly
lower for the Categorical Landuse Model than for the Landscape Predictor
Model, but the BIC metric is opposite, with the Landscape Predictor
Model indicated as the best model. While the two models may have similar
statistical test metrics, we are not confident in the transferability of
the Categorical Landuse Model to watersheds outside of the 14 in this
study. Two of the land use categories (Industrial - IND; and Low Density
Residential - LDR) each have only two watershed representatives in our
study, resulting in good model fit to the data, but not necessarily for
all watersheds in Puget Sound area.

three TSS models. For the Categorical Landuse Model, the baseline

coefficient values for linear mixed effects models are based on fitting
with restricted maximum likelihood (REML) estimation, and may differ
slightly from those fitted using maximum likelihood (ML) estimation.

differ slightly from those fitted using maximum likelihood (ML)
estimation.

The final Landscale Predictor Model for TSS, used as the basis of the
Stormwater heatmap TSS layer, is:

![
\\ln(TSS) = 10.17 + 0.19\*rain + 0.26\*sqrt.traffic + 0.30\*paved
](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.image?%5Cdpi%7B110%7D&space;%5Cbg_white&space;%0A%5Cln%28TSS%29%20%3D%2010.17%20%2B%200.19%2Arain%20%2B%200.26%2Asqrt.traffic%20%2B%200.30%2Apaved%0A "
\ln(TSS) = 10.17 + 0.19*rain + 0.26*sqrt.traffic + 0.30*paved
")

where rain is 1-day cumulative precipitation. Note that all predictors
were standardized prior to use.

### Phosphorus

Based on linear models of *ln*-transformed phosphorus versus individual
predictors, the strong predictors identified for phosphorus include:
sqrt_traffic, sqrt_popn, sqrt_slope, sqrt_CO2_res, sqrt_CO2_tot,
sqrt_CO2_road and devAge2 (Fig 4.16). Paved and grass were added to the
list because they were strong predictors for an older version of the
model, and both are associated with elevated phosphorus in stormwater.

![](images/Phosphorus%20strong%20predictors-01.bmp)

**Figure 4.16** Strong predictors for phosphorus, showing linear model
fit (blue line) for the relationship between ln-transformed phosphorus
concentration and each predictor in turn. Although they weren’t
compelling on their own, the predictors grass and paved were added to
the list of strong predictors because they were strong predictors in a
previous model.

The precipitation predictor used for phosphorus was 21-day cumulative
precipitation. In addition, evidence of higher phosphorus concentrations
during summer led us to add *summer* as a categorical predictor to the
phosphorus model (where *summer* = 1 during July, August, September, and
*summer* = 0 for all other months).

Residuals plotted against fitted values showed signs of slight
heterogeneity (Fig 4.17, left plot). Of the variance structures tested,
the best fit allows residual variation to differ by agency *j*:

$$
var(\epsilon_j) = \sigma^2_j
$$

![](images/Phosphorus%20variance%20structure.bmp)

**Figure 4.17** Normalized residuals from beyond-optimal model, with no
variance structure (left), and with the best fit variance structure
(right).

The best model for phosphorus is a random-intercept model, where the
intercept of the linear model is allowed to shift up or down according
to agency. No signs of temporal or spatial auto-correlation were
detected in auto-correlation plots or variograms.

With the variance structure and random components set, two possible
models emerged to capture the fixed effects:

$$\ln(Phosphorus) \sim rain + summer + grass + paved + sqrt.CO2.road$$


$$\ln(Phosphorus) \sim rain + summer + grass + paved$$


The AIC score for these two models was close, with the first model’s AIC
score lower than that of the second model (AIC=830.3 vs. 839.8, when
models were fitted with ML). As a result, we selected the first model.
Figure 4.18 shows the model fit for each individual predictor, plotted
against data points. Correlation between grass and paved was relatively
high (-0.8), while the other correlation coefficients were lower (-0.4,
-0.1). While this model fit the 14 watersheds in our study, the high
negative correlation betweeen paved and grass indicates the need for
caution with this model. There is good evidence to support a positive
relationship between phosphorous concentration and both residential
lawns (fertilizer) and paved roadways. For example, Waschbusch et al.
(1999) found that lawns and roads contributed \~80% of total and
dissolved phosphorous loading. Land use affects the contribution from
different sources, with lawns and leaf litter being more important in
residential areas and roads being more important in commercial and
industrial areas.

**Figure 4.18** Single-predictor plots for phosphorus, showing fit of
the Landscape Predictor Model to each predictor. Model fitting was
performed using maximum likelihood (ML) estimation.

Comparisons between the Null Model, Categorical Land Use Model, and
Landscape Predictor Model can be visualized through residuals (Fig.
4.19), comparative metrics such as AIC (Table 4.5), and coefficient
values (Table 4.5; Fig. 4.20). The lowest AIC value is for the Landscape
Predictor Model, indicating best fit to the phosphorus data of these
three models.

fitting was performed using maximum likelihood (ML) estimation.

three phosphorus models. For the Categorical Landuse Model, the baseline

and may differ slightly from those fitted using maximum likelihood (ML)
estimation.

Final coefficient values for linear mixed effects models are based on
fitting with restricted maximum likelihood (REML) estimation, and may
differ slightly from those fitted using maximum likelihood (ML)
estimation.

The Landscape Predictor Model for phosphorous, used as the basis for the
Stormwater Heatmap phosphorous layer, is:

$$\ln(Phosphorus) = 4.38 - 0.09*road + 0.60*summer + 0.83*grass + 0.97*paved + 0.20*sqrt.CO2.road$$


where rain is 21-day cumulative precipitation, and summer is a factor
with value = 1 for July, August, and September, and value = 0 for all
other months. Note that all predictors (except summer) were first
transformed if necessary (the square root was taken of CO2_road to
generate sqrt_CO2_road), then standardized prior to use.

### Total Zinc

Based on linear models of ln-transformed total zinc versus individual
predictors, the strong predictors identified for total zinc include:
totRES, intURB_IND, grass, greenery, paved, impervious, trees,
sqrt_traffic, pm25_na, sqrt_CO2_tot, sqrt_CO2_com, sqrt_CO2_nonroad,
roof_intURB_IND (Fig 4.21).

![](images/Total%20Zinc%20strong%20predictors%20plot.bmp)

**Figure 4.21** Strong predictors for total zinc, showing linear model
fit (blue line) for the relationsihp between *ln*-transformed total
zince concentration and each predictor in turn.

The precipitation predictor used for total zinc was 14-day cumulative
precipitation. In addition, evidence of higher total zinc concentrations
during summer led us to add *summer* as a categorical predictor to the
total zinc model (where *summer* = 1 during July, August, and September,
and *summer*= 0 for all other months).

Residuals plotted against fitted values showed a pattern, indicating a
chance of slight heteroskedasticity (Fig. 4.22, left plot). Of the
variance structures tested, the best fit allows residual variation to
differ by agency *j*.

$$var(\epsilon_j) = \sigma^2_j$$

![](images/Total%20Zinc%20variance%20structure%20plot.bmp)**Figure
4.22** Normalized residuals from beyond-optimal model, with no variance
structure (left), and with the best fit variance structure (right).

The best model for total zinc is a random-intercept model, where the
intercept of the linear model is allowed to shift up or down according
to agency. No signs of temporal or spatial auto-correlation were
detected in auto-correlation plots or variograms.

With the variance structure and random components set, three possible
models emerged to capture the fixed effects:
$$\ln(total.zinc) \sim rain + summer + sqrt.traffic + pm25.na + paved + rain:pm25.na
$$

$$\ln(total.zinc) \sim rain + summer + sqrt.traffic + pm25.na + greenery + rain:pm25.na$$


$$\ln(total.zinc) \sim rain + summer + trees + pm25.na + intURB.IND + rain:pm25.na + rain:intURB.IND$$

The AIC scores for these three models were close, with the first model’s
AIC score lower than that of the second or third models (AIC=784.6 vs.
788.1 and 792.1, when models were fitted with ML). As a result, we
selected the first model. Figure 4.23 shows the model fit for each
individual predictor, plotted against data points. Correlation between
the three predictors was low (maximum correlation coefficient = 0.5).
Figure 4.24 shows the interaction between rain and pm25_na, with higher
pm25_na values in reds and oranges, and lower pm25_na values in blues
and purples. This interaction shows that, when pm2.5 values are high,
increasing amounts of rainfall result in a dilution of zinc in
stormwater.

values, increasing amounts of rain result in a dilution of copper in

estimation.

Comparisons between the Null Model, Categorical Land Use Model, and
Landscape Predictor Model can be visualized through residuals (Fig.
4.25) and also coefficient values (Table 4.6; Fig. 4.26). The lowest AIC
value is for the Landscape Predictor Model, indicating best fit to the
total zinc data of these three models.

three total zinc models. For the Categorical Landuse Model, the baseline

values based on fitting with ML.

coefficients for the Null Model (green), Categorical Land Use Model
(blue), and Landscape Predictor Model (red). Final coefficient values
for linear mixed effects models are based on fitting with REML, and may
differ slightly from coefficient values based on fitting with ML.

The landscape predictor model for total zinc, used as the basis for the
Stormwater Heat Map total zinc layer, is:

$$\ln(total.zinc) = 4.09 - 0.13*rain + 0.43*summer + 0.30*sqrt.traffic + 0.38*pm25.na + 0.57*paved - 0.10*rain:pm25.na$$


where rain is 14-day cumulative precipitation, and summer is a factor
with value=1 for July, August, September, and value=0 for all other
months. Note that all predictors (except summer) were were first
transformed if necessary (the square root was taken of traffic to
generate sqrt_traffic), then standardized prior to use.

### Total Kjeldahl Nitrogen

Out of 420 Total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN) samples, 41 samples (9.8%) were
flagged as non-detects, with a variety of detection limits ranging from
30 to 500. The majority of non-detect samples came from three agencies:
Pierce County, Port of Tacoma, and Snohomish County (Fig. 4.27). High
detection limits in Pierce County and Port of Tacoma strongly truncated
the lower half of these data sets.

![](images/Kjeldahl%20Nitrogen%20non-detects.png)**Figure 4.27**
Concentrations of total Kjeldahl nitrogen in samples collected by
agency. Red dots indicate detected values, while blue dots indicate the
detection limit for samples flagged as non-detect.

Based on linear models of *ln*-transformed TKN versus individual
predictors, the strong predictors identified for TKN include: roofs,
nodev, traffic, sqrt_popn, sqrt_CO2_res, sqrt_CO2_tot, sqrt_CO2_road,
devAge2, roof_inURB and roof_intURB_IND (Fig. 4.28).

![](images/Kjeldahl%20Nitrogen%20strong%20predictors%20plot.bmp)**Figure
4.28** Strong predictors for total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN), showing
linear model fit (blue line) for the relationship between
*ln*-transformed TKN concentration and each predictor in turn.

The precipitation predictor used for TKN was 14-day cumulative
precipitation. In addition, evidence of higher TKN concentrations during
summer led us to add summer as a categorical predictor to the TKN model
(where summer = 1 during July, August, September, and summer = 0 for all
other months).

Residuals plotted against fitted values showed signs of slight
heterogeneity (Fig. 4.29, left plot). Of the variance structures tested,
the best fit allows residual variation to differ by agency j.

$$
var(\epsilon_j)=\sigma^2_j
$$

![](images/Kjeldahl%20Nitrogen%20variance%20structure%20plot.bmp)**Figure
4.29** Normalized residuals from beyond-optimal model, with no variance
structure (left), and with the best fit variance structure (right).

The best model for TKN is a random-intercept model, where the intercept
of the linear model is allowed to shift up or down according to agency.
No signs of temporal or spatial auto-correlation were detected in
auto-correlation plots or variograms. With the variance structure and
random components set, three possible models emerged to capture the
fixed effects:

$$\ln(TKN) \sim rain + summer + sqrt.traffic + devAge2$$

$$\ln(TKN) \sim rain + summer + sqrt.CO2.road + devAge2$$
$$
\ln(TKN) \sim rain + summer + sqrt.traffic + nodev
$$

Each of these models captures two major contributors to total nitrogen:
vehicles and amount/age of development. The AIC scores for all three
models were close, with the models ordered from lowest to highest AIC
score (907.8, 912.2, 915.8, when models were fitted using ML).

We selected the second model, with landscape predictors sqrt_CO2_road +
devAge2. While all models fit the data reasonably well, we opted to use
the slightly coarser-scale predictor sqrt_CO2_road rather than
sqrt_traffic. The amount of traffic on Puget Sound freeways exceeds the
traffic in our dataset by an order of magnitude, and the TKN vs.
sqrt_traffic relationship may lose its linear shape at high traffic
levels. In contrast, the CO2_road values in our dataset range from about
150 to 7900, while the range of pixel values for the entire Puget Sound
region is 0 to 12,700. Less than 0.3% of pixels exceed 7900. This lends
greater confidence to the TKN model with sqrt_CO2_road as a predictor.
Figure 4.30 shows the model fit for each individual predictor, plotted
against data points. Correlation between the two predictors was low
(correlation coefficient = 0.4).

![](images/Kjeldahl%20Nitrogen%20single%20predictors.bmp)**Figure 4.30**
Single-predictor plots for total Kjeldahl nitrogen, showing fit of the
Landscape Predictor Model to each predictor. Model fitting was performed
using maximum likelihood (ML) estimation.

Comparisons between the Null Model, Categorical Land Use Model, and
Landscape Predictor Model can be visualized through residuals (Fig.
4.31), comparative metrics such as AIC (Table 4.7), and coefficient
values (Table 4.7; Fig. 4.32). Although the AIC value for the
Categorical Land Use Model is lower than that of the Landscape Predictor
Model, we are not confident in the transferability of the Categorical
Land Use Model to watersheds outside of the 14 in this study. Two of the
land use categories (Industrial – IND; and Low Density Residential –
LDR) each have only two watershed representatives in our study. This
results in good model fit to the data, but not necessarily for all

Censored data made up 9.7% of the TKN sample results. Although the EPA
allows substitution of (0.5 x detection limit) for censored values when
\< 15% of samples are non-detect (USEPA, 2009), we wanted to verify that
substitution did not have a large effect on the parameter values for our
dataset. Censored methods have not yet been developed for mixed effects
models; as a result, we performed the (0.5 x detection limit)
substitution for the TKN data, and fit a simple linear model using the
predictors: 14-day rainfall, summer, sqrt_CO2_road and devAge2. We
compared the parameter values to a censored data model using the NADA
package in R (Lee, 2020), and found that the two models had very similar
parameter values (Table 4.8). This confirmed that the TKN data with (0.5
x detection limit) substitution could be used to generate valid models
using mixed effects techniques.

The Landscape Predictor Model for TKN, used as the basis for the
Stormwater Heat Map TKN layer, is:
 $$
\ln(TKN) = 6.52 - 0.15 (rain) + 0.60(summer) + \\
 0.28(sqrt.CO2.road) + 0.22(devAge2)
$$

where rain is 14-day cumulative precipitation, and summer is a factor
with value=1 for July, August, September, and value=0 for all other
months. Note that all predictors (except summer) were first transformed
if necessary (the square root was taken of CO2_road to generate
sqrt_CO2_road; devAge was squared to generate devAge2), then
standardized prior to use.

## Translating Equations to the Stormwater Heatmap

The process of translating statistical equations for chemical
contaminants to the Stormwater heatmap involved manipulation of the grid
and equations.

### Convolving the Base Map

The first step of translating COC equations to the Stormwater Heatmap
was to convolve each grid on the base map. Following convolution of the
map, regression equations were applied to each grid box to predict the
concentration of contaminants expected for that grid box.

For COCs with traffic as a predictor (copper, TSS, zinc), the maximum
traffic level in the grid map was clamped to 31,000 AADT. This upper
limit corresponds to the maximum level of traffic found in the
watersheds that provided data used for generating statistical equations.
On freeways, which were not analyzed in this study, traffic
conventrations can reach 240,000 AADT. By clamping traffic, we avoid
extrapolating beyond the range of our data. This is a conservative
approach because landscape predictors may not behave in a linear fashion
at values beyond our range. Indeed, when the traffic level is clamped at
31,000 AADT for TSS, predicted TSS values on freeways are in the same
range as those found on freeways across the country (data from USGS
Highway Runoff Database). This suggests that, for some COCs, traffic may
be a linear predictor over the values found in our data, but may reach
an asymptote at higher values.

### Applying Mixed Effects Equations to the Stormwater Heatmap

Utilizing a mixed effects model structure, along with a variance
structure to account for heteroskedasticity, allowed us to obtain the
best parameter values for each COC. The difference in parameter values
generated by equations with and without random effects and/or variance
structure illustrates how parameter values change according to the
equation structure. For example, for total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN),
regression values for each parameter can be compared for four models: 1)
full model with random effects and variance structure, 2) random effects
only (no variance structure), 3) variance structure only (no random
effects), and 4) no random effects and no variance structure (Table
4.9). By specifying the correct random effects (i.e. random effects by
agency) and variance structure (i.e. variance co-variate = agency) for
TKN, we find the most appropriate fit to the data for the relationship
between this COC and the suite of predictors.

With respect to translating mixed effects model equations to the
Stormwater Heatmap to generate predictions for each grid box, the model
becomes simplified. This is because we are interested in predicted COC
values for the entire Puget Sound region, rather than the COC values
that would be generated by the collection timing, analysis protocol, or
biases of a specific agency. As such, we can largely ignore the
agency-specific intercepts. We thus utilize the fitted value of the
intercept for *all* watersheds and agencies in the Stormwater Heatmap,
and do not adjust the intercept up or down according to agency. This
allows us to predict COC values for the entire Puget Sound model domain,
which is comprehensive of watersheds *outside* the agency boundaries for
which we have monitoring data.

When it comes applying the variance structure to the full model domain
of the heatmap, these effects have already been incorporated into the
best fit model (Table 4.8). We accounted for the mild heteroskedasticity
evident in COCs by specifying the variance structure to properly weigh
the impact of each data point on the best fit model. No further
extension of the variable structure is necessary for generating model
predictions on the Stormwater Heatmap.

**Table 4.9** Parameter values for four models of total Kjeldahl
nitorgen: 1) full model with random effects and variance structure;
2)random effects only (no variance structure); 3) variance structure
only (no random effects); 4) no random effects, no variance structure.
Models are for illustrative purposes only, to show the effect of
variance stucture and random effects on parameter values for predictor
variables.

[1] Phase I Permittees include: cities of Tacoma and Seattle; King,
Snohomish, Pierce and Clark counties; Ports of Tacoma and Seattle.  For
this study, all data were used with the exception of those from Clark
County (outside of the Puget Sound region) and Port of Seattle (too
different from all other Puget Sound watersheds).

[2] As described in Faraway (2006), pg 156, REML estimation should not
be used to compare models with different fixed effects because REML
estimates the random effects by considering linear combinations of the
data that remove the fixed effects. If the fixed effects change, the
likelihoods of the two models will not be directly comparable. However,
REML is generally considered to give better estimates for the random
effects, so final models were fitted with REML
