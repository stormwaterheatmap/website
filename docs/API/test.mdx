# Document Title

This is a regular paragraph. To learn more about Docusaurus, you should
visit the official <ExternalLink href="https://docusaurus.io">Docusaurus website</ExternalLink>.

You can also use it to link to other external resources, like
<ExternalLink href="https://github.com">GitHub</ExternalLink>. Internal links
still work the old-fashioned way, like this one to [another doc](./another-doc.md).
