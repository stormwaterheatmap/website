title: Two-Column Layout Example

# Page with Two Columns

This is a standard paragraph that spans the full width of the page. Below, we will create two columns.

<div className="row">
  <div className="col col--4">
    ### First Column

    This content is in the left column. You can put any Markdown or React components here.

    - Item A
    - Item B
    - Item C

  </div>
  <div className="col col--8">
    ### Second Column

    This content is in the right column. It's perfect for placing complementary information, code snippets, or images side-by-side.

    
  </div>
</div>

And here the layout returns to a single column.
